Hey there, and welcome to the first blog post on Automation and Curiosities! 
I've created this Website as a way to share my continued progress, experiences (good or bad), and knowledge gained while working on Automating the World! 

Well, to be specific, the scope is actually the  wonderful "World" of simulated ecosystems and environments! 

<img src="/images/before_and_after.jpg" align="center" width="550" style="margin-right: 30px"/>

One of my main goals with these types of posts and the content I create is to both provide knowledge to others, as well as show some of the problems I have run into, while cataloguing and providing visual supplements that aid in understanding!

```
I am a code block!
This is the second line!
Would "Hello World" have been better?
```
Most posts will include a link to the source, hosted on a Git Repository from my account [CyrusDS](https://github.com/CyrusDS) and may also reference code through the use of blocks, like so! 




See [What is LEAP?](https://curiouscyrus.me/post/starting-a-project/) for more specific info on the Paludarium Automation Project!


<!-- In continually advancing this large project, I aim to utilize and employ modern engineering practices in order to create a modern environment that links both the wonders of Nature, and the capabilities of Technology. I love the capacity to create an entire living microcosm which can be combined with modern technological tools, and I hope you may find some love in this as well!  -->

Thank you (yes, you!) for taking the time to read through this intro, I'm very excited for your thoughts and suggestions! Feel free to comment on any blog post regarding anything at all!
