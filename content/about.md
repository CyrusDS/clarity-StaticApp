Systems Design, Plants, and having Computers do things for you are three things I love! Why not have all at once?

\n

I have many pleasures and enjoyments, but challenging myself to do things that allow me to grow further as a learner and person, as well as documenting my learning experiences are a few that tend to stand out to me! 
\
I also love to spend time exploring in nature, as well as relaxing with my goofball of a pooch!
