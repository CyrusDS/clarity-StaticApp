Systems Design, Plants, and having Computers do things for you are three things I love! Why not have all at once?

\n

Besides working in IT Systems Administration for my University while working towards my degree, I most recently worked with NVMe SSD Storage Systems, writing Embedded C Firmware on RTOS platforms, and making FPGA system design modifications using Xilinx Products. 

###### At the moment, I'm looking toward new opportunities!

The first time I became captivated by computers while in the 7th grade attending a STEM Middle School, where I took an entry level programming course that also exposed me to the world of Microcontrollers! (in the form of Arduino, a simplified version of C++)

Being able to create a device that was equipped with a number of digital and analog sensors that could interact with the external world and then translate that to numbers which a computer could interpret was, AND still is incredible to me! Not to mention, also reprogrammable on-the-fly?!

\
In taking this course, I actually managed to get my first contracted work (20 whole hours!) designing and programming a DNA cycler which used a TEC ([Thermo Electric Cooler](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermoelectric-coolers)).
\
In essence, these two-sided heat pumps are able to cool one side of the device, while simultaneously heating the other. See the [Peltier Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect#Peltier_effect) for more! 
\
\
The DNA cycling system I worked on performed timed heating + cooling operations whose length and intensity depended upon a thermistor measuring temperature within the DNA chamber, and was implemented on an ATmega328P!

\
One key component of this interaction, is that without external factors (eg. fans) the heat will ultimately overtake the cooling! It is essential to balance this!

I have also been a long-time advocate of 3D-Printing technologies and tinkerer, gaining a fair amount of experience with 3D CAD Software tools (Autodesk, Solidworks, Blender) which has helped me develop prototyping skills when bringing ideas to physical life!

<!-- I have many pleasures and enjoyments, but challenging myself to do things that allow me to grow further as a learner and person, as well as documenting my learning experiences are a few that tend to stand out to me!  -->
In my free time, I often volunteer for the [FBLC](https://foodbanklarimer.org/) to help in the mission of ending hunger for those facing food insecurity, as well as reducing food waste - something that is not talked about enough. 
\
To put some numbers from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/food-material-specific-data) in perspective, the __EPA estimates that in 2019, 66 million tons of wasted food was generated in the food retail, food service, and residential sectors, and most of this waste (about 60%) was sent to landfills__

\
Feeding people (for free) is one of the major ways to divert a lot of these foods while also aiding social causes. My local food bank saves about 93% of the food donated by organizations such as Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Sprouts, and others. 
\
\
I highly encourage anyone to get involved with a food rescue organization, as I've found it to be a fantastic way to make a difference in a community, while also contributing to a more sustainable world!

Beyond this, I also love to spend time exploring in nature, as well as relaxing with my goofball of a pooch! Also, what ecosystem wouldn't be complete without a predator of some sort? My veiled chameleon, Dilbert, often enjoys preying on small critters such as crickets and waxworms.
