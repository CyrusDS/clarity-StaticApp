# Cyrus' Curious Blog

Here's the repo for my static website which uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the [Clarity theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-clarity/) 

Compilation is simple, after navigating to directory with the repo simply run
```
hugo server
```

Then go to [http://locahost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to view the site
