            Intro - Defining Components of LEAP: This post details the process I went through while working on the initial planning of the Paludarium, to organize and sort the possible scope of the Living Ecosystem Automation Project.
This was one of the first times I used a Mind map, but I found it to help sort some ideas I had previously written down, but did not have collected in any meaningful matter to share.

            Documenting a New Project: Hey there, and welcome to the first blog post on Automation and Curiosities! I&#39;ve created this Website as a way to share my continued progress, experiences (good or bad), and knowledge gained while working on Automating the World!
Well, to be specific, the scope is actually the wonderful &amp;quot;World&amp;quot; of simulated ecosystems and environments!
One of my main goals with these types of posts and the content I create is to both provide knowledge to others, as well as show some of the problems I have run into, while cataloguing and providing visual supplements that aid in understanding!

            So, what exactly is this?? LEAP - Living Ecosystem Automation Project LEAP is a project I have been slowly building a plan together for since as early as 09/26/2023 when looking to incorporate water and land elements in a living ecosystem, after becoming inspired by some excellently designed enclosures that other hobbyists have designed in recent years.
Eventually, this morphed into something where I wanted to combine my skills and knowledge in Embedded Systems design with a goal of creating multiple subsystems run by specialized microcontrollers, which could vary between irrigation controls, livestreamed camera feed, humidity tracking, and much more.
