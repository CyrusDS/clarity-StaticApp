            Info:This post details the process I went through while working on this Blog website and ultimately hosting it here at https://curiouscyrus.me/ which is hosted through an Azure Static Web App and Deployed using a Github Actions CI/CD workflow.
For more information on why this blog exists, and the content on it, see What is LEAP? You can also find the accompanying public repository for my Web app here as well!

            So, what exactly is this?? LEAP - Living Ecosystem Automation Project LEAP is a project I have been slowly building a plan together for since as early as 09/26/2023 when looking to incorporate water and land elements in a living ecosystem, after becoming inspired by some excellently designed enclosures that other hobbyists have designed in recent years.
Eventually, this morphed into something where I wanted to combine my skills and knowledge in Embedded Systems design with a goal of creating multiple subsystems run by specialized microcontrollers, which could vary between irrigation controls, livestreamed camera feed, humidity tracking, and much more.
