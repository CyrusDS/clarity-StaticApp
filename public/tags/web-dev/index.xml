            Documenting a New Project Hey there, and welcome to the first blog post on Automation and Curiosities! I&#39;ve created this Website as a way to share my continued progress, experiences (good or bad), and knowledge gained while working on Automating the World!
Well, to be specific, the scope is actually the wonderful &amp;quot;World&amp;quot; of simulated ecosystems and environments!
In continually advancing this large project, I aim to utilize and employ modern engineering practices in order to create a modern environment that links both the wonders of Nature, and the capabilities of Technology.

            So, what exactly is this?? LEAP - Living Ecosystem Automation Project LEAP is a project I have been slowly building a plan together for since as early as 09/26/2023 when looking to incorporate water and land elements in a living ecosystem, after becoming inspired by some excellently designed enclosures that other hobbyists have designed in recent years.
Eventually, this morphed into something where I wanted to combine my skills and knowledge in Embedded Systems design with a goal of creating multiple subsystems run by specialized microcontrollers, which could vary between irrigation controls, livestreamed camera feed, humidity tracking, and much more.
