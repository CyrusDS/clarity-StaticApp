Because it has alt text but no title text, the caption is generated by the alt text.\nRemote image, specified caption The following image is loaded from a remote URL. The alt text is the same (for screen readers and in cases when the image doesn't load) but because a separate title is provided, the title is used for the caption:\nThis is Jane Doe\rImage with alt text and no caption Alt text is always recommended for SEO, accessibility and in cases when images don't load. However, you don't necessarily always want an image to have a caption. In that case, use a title with one space:\nBlockquotes The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a footer or cite element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.\nBlockquote without attribution Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae. Note that you can use Markdown syntax within a blockquote.\nBlockquote with attribution Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.\n— Rob Pike1\nTables Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports supports them out-of-the-box.\nName Age Bob 27 Alice 23 Inline Markdown within tables Italics Bold Code italics bold code Code Blocks Code block with backticks 1\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Example HTML5 Document\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 6\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Test\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 10\u0026lt;!-- this line is extraneous 2Error from server (Forbidden): deployments.apps is forbidden: User \u0026#34;chiptest\u0026#34; cannot create resource \u0026#34;deployments\u0026#34; in API group \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34; in the namespace \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; --\u0026gt; 11\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Code block indented with four spaces \u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;html lang=\u0026quot;en\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026quot;utf-8\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Example HTML5 Document\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Test\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\rCode block with Hugo's internal highlight shortcode 1\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Example HTML5 Document\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 6\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Test\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 10\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; List Types Ordered List First item Second item Third item Unordered List List item Another item And another item Nested list Fruit Apple Orange Banana Dairy Milk Cheese Other Elements — abbr, sub, sup, kbd, mark GIF is a bitmap image format.\nH2O\nXn + Yn = Zn\nPress CTRL+ALT+Delete to end the session.\nMost salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms, and other small creatures.\nThe above quote is excerpted from Rob Pike's talk during Gopherfest, November 18, 2015.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","link":"https://example.com/pt/post/markdown-syntax/","section":"post","tags":["markdown","css","html","temas","destacado"],"title":"Guia de Sintaxe Markdown"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/series/guia-de-temas/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Guia de Temas"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/tags/html/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"html"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/tags/markdown/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"markdown"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/post/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/categories/sintaxe/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"sintaxe"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/tags/temas/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"temas"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/pt/categories/temas/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"temas"},{"body":"Tradução em português.
