I've created this Website as a way to share my continued progress, experiences (good or bad), and knowledge gained while working on Automating the World!\nWell, to be specific, the scope is actually the wonderful \u0026quot;World\u0026quot; of simulated ecosystems and environments!\nIn continually advancing this large project, I aim to utilize and employ modern engineering practices in order to create a modern environment that links both the wonders of Nature, and the capabilities of Technology. I love the capacity to create an entire living microcosm which can be combined with modern technological tools, and I hope you may find some love in this as well!\nThank you (yes, you!) for taking the time to read through this intro, I'm very excited for your thoughts and suggestions! Feel free to comment on any blog post regarding anything at all!\n","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/post/leaps/","section":"post","tags":["blogging"],"title":"When an idea becomes a plan, then a plan becomes action"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/videos/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"videos"},{"body":" YouTube Videos will be shown below as they are posted!

Why not have all at once?\r\\n\nBesides working in IT Systems Administration for my University while working towards my degree, I most recently worked with NVMe SSD Storage Systems, writing Embedded C Firmware on RTOS platforms, and making FPGA system design modifications using Xilinx Products.\nAt the moment, I'm looking toward new opportunities! The first time I became captivated by computers while in the 7th grade attending a STEM Middle School, where I took an entry level programming course that also exposed me to the world of Microcontrollers! (in the form of Arduino, a simplified version of C++)\nBeing able to create a device that was equipped with a number of digital and analog sensors that could interact with the external world and then translate that to numbers which a computer could interpret was, AND still is incredible to me! Not to mention, also reprogrammable on-the-fly?!\nIn taking this course, I actually managed to get my first contracted work (20 whole hours!) designing and programming a DNA cycler which used a TEC (Thermo Electric Cooler). In essence, these two-sided heat pumps are able to cool one side of the device, while simultaneously heating the other. See the Peltier Effect for more! The DNA cycling system I worked on performed timed heating + cooling operations whose length and intensity depended upon a thermistor measuring temperature within the DNA chamber, and was implemented on an ATmega328P!\nOne key component of this interaction, is that without external factors (eg. fans) the heat will ultimately overtake the cooling! It is essential to balance this!\nI have also been a long-time advocate of 3D-Printing technologies and tinkerer, gaining a fair amount of experience with 3D CAD Software tools (Autodesk, Solidworks, Blender) which has helped me develop prototyping skills when bringing ideas to physical life! In my free time, I often volunteer for the FBLC to help in the mission of ending hunger for those facing food insecurity, as well as reducing food waste - something that is not talked about enough. To put some numbers from the EPA in perspective, the EPA estimates that in 2019, 66 million tons of wasted food was generated in the food retail, food service, and residential sectors, and most of this waste (about 60%) was sent to landfills Feeding people (for free) is one of the major ways to divert a lot of these foods while also aiding social causes. My local food bank saves about 93% of the food donated by organizations such as Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Sprouts, and others. I highly encourage anyone to get involved with a food rescue organization, as I've found it to be a fantastic way to make a difference in a community, while also contributing to a more sustainable world!\nBeyond this, I also love to spend time exploring in nature, as well as relaxing with my goofball of a pooch! Also, what ecosystem wouldn't be complete without a predator of some sort? My veiled chameleon, Dilbert, often enjoys preying on small critters such as crickets and waxworms.\nFeel free to contact me at my email ","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"Who am I?"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/youtube/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"youtube"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/first/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"first"},{"body":"\rSo, what exactly is this?? LEAP - Living Ecosystem Automation Project LEAP is a project I have been slowly building a plan together for since as early as 09/26/2023 when looking to incorporate water and land elements in a living ecosystem, after becoming inspired by some excellently designed enclosures that other hobbyists have designed in recent years.\nEventually, this morphed into something where I wanted to combine my skills and knowledge in Embedded Systems design with a goal of creating multiple subsystems run by specialized microcontrollers, which could vary between irrigation controls, livestreamed camera feed, humidity tracking, and much more.\nAdditionally, these subsystems would be designed such that they report to an underlying main processing system, running on a Real-Time OS, handling queries in a task oriented style. For this to be most convenient, such an automated system also needs to be able to interface to a network so that all data streams can be accessed in real time and so the system itself can respond to queries sent by an Administrator (That's me!)\nWhat the heck is a Paludarium? Terrariums, Vivariums, or Paludariums, are all semi or fully enclosed systems have a multitude of qualities which are essential to properly maintaining the health of the entire biome.\nCheck here to find out more about the differences between these three types of \u0026quot;ariums\u0026quot; Where does Automation come in? In order to ensure ideal conditions that would allow the flora, fauna, as well as underlying micro-organisms to thrive, there is a significant value to automatically adjusting (our controlled) environment in response to measured biological indicators of health.\nMethods to determine this can vary from the precise monitoring and control of the enclosed system's humidity, temperature, soil and water pH, as well as many more crucially important aspects such as adaptable scheduling for lighting and water distribution.\n(See project index and breakdown for further information on the overall system design and sub-projects encompassing this entire automation task! Between CAD, PCB design, web dev, embedded RTOS, investigations into communication protocols, and MUCH more, there is a lot to check out!) Having such closely related but independently controlled sub-systems allows these components to be encapsulated within dedicated embedded systems that can then be controlled by an underlying master through a common communication protocol.\nOverview last updated - 01/08/2024 ","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/post/starting-a-project/","section":"post","tags":["blogging","web dev","first"],"title":"LEAP - A new initiative"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/web-dev/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"web dev"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
