In working on this Mind Map, I was able to more clearly compartmentalize different sections of this overall large project, and visualize it in a way that makes sense - at least, to me!\nEight Main Components Starting from the center of the Map, there are eight branches that I considered essential to the goals of the project.\nEcosystem Health Monitoring - Peripherals such as temperature or humidity sensors Terrestrial Management - Food and Water control for land-bound Flora and Fauna Aquatic Management - Food and Water Control for immersed life. Physical Features - How the actual Paludarium will look and the types of geographical features. This is less related to the Technological side of LEAP, but is a key component to having a realistic and beautiful environment. Ambient Features - This covers the \u0026quot;look and feel\u0026quot; of the Paludarium, bringing it to life, and adding some style. Photoperiodism - Similar to the Ambient Features, proper lighting that covers the PAR (photosynthetic active radition) region of wavelengths and scheduling the lighting itself is paramount to thriving life. Remote Management - Lastly, another mandatory requirement for LEAP is to have convenient methods of interfacing with the system, as well as addressing individual subcomponents through queries, or application based management. Ecosystem Health Monitoring Most of the sensors are organized within this Monitoring section. At a high level, these system inputs will be used to help determine additional adjustments that may be needed in order to ensure the health of life within.\nFor example, a low humidity may indicate that the system requires additional misting or waterflow to be delivered.\nUltimately, most of the monitoring of may be contained to one embedded controller, which then reports to the main system which then issues appropriate commands to an appropriate output controller, such as the misting system.\nTerrestrial Management Automatically providing sustenance for plants and animals will be handled through Auto Feeding and Auto Watering components. Irrigation wise, both a pumped misting system as well as a \u0026quot;Spray Bar\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Drip Wall\u0026quot; will be implemented, providing moisture on the Paludarium background that plant life will enjoy.\nI also want to include a Waterfall feature which can have its flow diverted via a servo, which could also reveal a hidden cave. This part is more of a \u0026quot;fun feature\u0026quot; ðŸ™‚\n","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/post/brainstorming/","section":"post","tags":["brainstorming","LEAP","blogging"],"title":"Brainstorming LEAP's Features"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/leap/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"LEAP"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/post/","section":"post","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/analytics/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Analytics"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/azure/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Azure"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/cloud/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cloud"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/dns/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"DNS"},{"body":"\rInfo:\rThis post details the process I went through while working on this Blog website and ultimately hosting it here at https://curiouscyrus.me/\nFor more information on why this blog exists, and the content on it, see What is LEAP? You can also find the accompanying public repository for my Web app here as well!\nDeciding on the Type of Website One of the first steps on my Website creation adventure was to determine the type of website that would be suited for my specific application. For this Website, I wanted a blog-style interface which would allow sufficient customization with site organization while also keeping things simple in terms of adding new content to the Website\nIn this case, I also have no need to store any user data or perform complicated operations that would require real time updates, and the priority is to provide a quick and snappy experience. Therefore, the most appropriate type of website was a Static Website. The next steps were to determine a Website Framework to use, or whether to start from scratch!\nWebsite Frameworks - Hugo Hugo allows you to write pages for websites with Markdown, which was a major factor in why I decided to go with it. Partly, my goal for this Website and Domain is to display educational posts - therefore, being able to easily add posts in a simple formatting is ideal! Having worked with LaTeX in courses previously.. and not being a huge fan, Markdown is a nice switch!\nI also figured with the widespread applicability of Markdown as a practical documentation method, I oughta' get some practice ðŸ˜‰\nInstalling Hugo Working with Hugo is fairly straightforward, though, when it comes down to customizing your website - there are a few nuances based on your Theming choices.. more on this later! For my Windows system, I used Chocolatey and while running an admin powershell, install simply required\n1 choco install hugo Theming.. and Re-Theming... The Hugo tutorial uses the Ananke theme, which I initially worked with while evaluating the feasibility of Hugo itself, and whether I was going to continue to run with it when making this Website!\nBefore looking at hosting the Static Website I made in a few minutes with Hugo, I ran the local instance via\n1 hugo server I customized a few elements on the default theme, such as the background color, experimented with adding a post or two, and looked at some of the options you can customize via the built in hugo.toml files.\nAfter evaluating that Hugo seemed sufficient while visiting some friends in WA, I commited the initial repository to save my work and then visit a few days later when I would be back in Colorado. In the mean time, I was interested in looking at some of the public options on the themes subpage of Hugo and found Clarity which caught my eye much more.\nOne major thing to note about themes in Hugo though, is that each Theme has its own subset of parameters and conventions which influence how the HTML and CSS is built and then subsequently displayed. In switching to Clarity, I did have to essentially re-orient myself with the Framework. In the case of Clarity, one unique feature is that the regular hugo.toml file that I mentioned earlier, is actually unused. Instead, it has been re-implemented as a set of .toml files within the \\config_default folder.\nI find this method to provide greater customization, and also found it to be fairly intuitive, for example you can see the Header menu bar being configured below in the .toml for the menu.\n1[[main]] 2 name = \u0026#34;Home\u0026#34; 3 url = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; 4 weight = -110 5 6[[main]] 7 name = \u0026#34;Videos\u0026#34; 8 url = \u0026#34;post/rich-content/\u0026#34; 9 weight = -105 10[[main]] 11 name = \u0026#34;What is LEAP?\u0026#34; 12 url = \u0026#34;post/starting-a-project/\u0026#34; 13 weight = -107 Technically, this is the menu in English, since Clarity provides support for language switching. Sadly, I'm not a polyglot, and my French is a bit rusty so I am not using this feature ðŸ˜…\nThere are plenty more customizations I made to adapt the base Clarity theme to my goals and intents, including adding a CSS override file to change the background colors when building the site, which is output to the public/ folder. See that here\nChoosing a Hosting Method - Microsoft Azure: Cloud Computing Next, to actually get the Website to be Live, we need a method of hosting. I decided to go with Azure, as I have some experience with Microsoft's Cloud hosting service, and they also offer free subscription plans for lighter workloads and non-business use - perfectly appropriate for this application!\nAzure offers a significant amount of resource creation options, including one to create a Static Web App.\nGithub Workflow and CI/CD When setting up the Static Web App, there are options to link a Github account and enable link the repository for your static web app to. In addition to that, there is also a Build Preset Option that allows you to select a premade workflow for Hugo. Once this is done, any updates to the main branch of the repository will result in Github running a workflow and upon succesful completion, the website is automatically redeployed through Azure.\nMore info on the Build Configuration here For me, this simplifies updating the live site versus making edits to my local page, and allows me to more quickly and rapidly make changes, such as adding new posts, updating page elements, and beyond.\nThe entire process is a matter of checking in any new or changed files, adding a commit message, pushing through git, then waiting a few minutes! Here's what it all looks like\n1 git add . 2 git commit -m \u0026#34;Added Trials and Tribulations of Web Hosting post\u0026#34; 3 git push Then we hop over to github, wait for build completion, And now the site is up and hosted on my Domain! Well, actually, it's hosted on the Azure auto-generated URL, which I've re-pointed to the https://curiouscyrus.me domain that I purchased (on a yearly subscription) through squarespace and subsequently mapped. See how I did that next!\nPurchasing and Using a Domain I purchased my domain from squarespace here here. Once that was done, it was a matter of navigating to the Custom Domains tab in Azure, and following the steps to Setting this part of was actually fairly simple, and was a matter of waiting for the Validation to pass and a green check mark to pop up âœ… For more detailed info, check Microsoft's official resource\nGoogle Analytics and More One of the last things I wanted to implement early on with the Website was a method of tracking the Analytics and viewer statistics of the website. The Hugo Clarity theme supports this integration fairly easily within the params.toml once you have acquired your analytics ID. I had to create an Analytics account, add the https://curiouscyrus.me website, and followed a few more easy steps.\n1# Google analytics Id 2ga_analytics = \u0026#34;G-MY7YCM38VS\u0026#34; Once this was done, I was able to start collecting web traffic and viewing it. Below you can see the first bit of traffic, from myself!

Why not have all at once?\r\\n\nBesides working in IT Systems Administration for my University while working towards my degree, I most recently worked with NVMe SSD Storage Systems, writing Embedded C Firmware on RTOS platforms, and making FPGA system design modifications using Xilinx Products.\nAt the moment, I'm looking toward new opportunities! The first time I became captivated by computers while in the 7th grade attending a STEM Middle School, where I took an entry level programming course that also exposed me to the world of Microcontrollers! (in the form of Arduino, a simplified version of C++)\nBeing able to create a device that was equipped with a number of digital and analog sensors that could interact with the external world and then translate that to numbers which a computer could interpret was, AND still is incredible to me! Not to mention, also reprogrammable on-the-fly?!\nIn taking this course, I actually managed to get my first contracted work (20 whole hours!) designing and programming a DNA cycler which used a TEC (Thermo Electric Cooler). In essence, these two-sided heat pumps are able to cool one side of the device, while simultaneously heating the other. See the Peltier Effect for more! The DNA cycling system I worked on performed timed heating + cooling operations whose length and intensity depended upon a thermistor measuring temperature within the DNA chamber, and was implemented on an ATmega328P!\nOne key component of this interaction, is that without external factors (eg. fans) the heat will ultimately overtake the cooling! It is essential to balance this!\nI have also been a long-time advocate of 3D-Printing technologies and tinkerer, gaining a fair amount of experience with 3D CAD Software tools (Autodesk, Solidworks, Blender) which has helped me develop prototyping skills when bringing ideas to physical life! In my free time, I often volunteer for the FBLC to help in the mission of ending hunger for those facing food insecurity, as well as reducing food waste - something that is not talked about enough. To put some numbers from the EPA in perspective, the EPA estimates that in 2019, 66 million tons of wasted food was generated in the food retail, food service, and residential sectors, and most of this waste (about 60%) was sent to landfills Feeding people (for free) is one of the major ways to divert a lot of these foods while also aiding social causes. My local food bank saves about 93% of the food donated by organizations such as Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Sprouts, and others. I highly encourage anyone to get involved with a food rescue organization, as I've found it to be a fantastic way to make a difference in a community, while also contributing to a more sustainable world!\nBeyond this, I also love to spend time exploring in nature, as well as relaxing with my goofball of a pooch! Also, what ecosystem wouldn't be complete without a predator of some sort? My veiled chameleon, Dilbert, often enjoys preying on small critters such as crickets and waxworms.\nFeel free to contact me at my email ","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"Who am I?"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/youtube/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"youtube"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/first/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"first"},{"body":"\rSo, what exactly is this?? LEAP - Living Ecosystem Automation Project LEAP is a project I have been slowly building a plan together for since as early as 09/26/2023 when looking to incorporate water and land elements in a living ecosystem, after becoming inspired by some excellently designed enclosures that other hobbyists have designed in recent years.\nEventually, this morphed into something where I wanted to combine my skills and knowledge in Embedded Systems design with a goal of creating multiple subsystems run by specialized microcontrollers, which could vary between irrigation controls, livestreamed camera feed, humidity tracking, and much more.\nAdditionally, these subsystems would be designed such that they report to an underlying main processing system, running on a Real-Time OS, handling queries in a task oriented style. For this to be most convenient, such an automated system also needs to be able to interface to a network so that all data streams can be accessed in real time and so the system itself can respond to queries sent by an Administrator (That's me!)\nWhat the heck is a Paludarium? Terrariums, Vivariums, or Paludariums, are all semi or fully enclosed systems have a multitude of qualities which are essential to properly maintaining the health of the entire biome.\nCheck here to find out more about the differences between these three types of \u0026quot;ariums\u0026quot; Where does Automation come in? In order to ensure ideal conditions that would allow the flora, fauna, as well as underlying micro-organisms to thrive, there is a significant value to automatically adjusting (our controlled) environment in response to measured biological indicators of health.\nMethods to determine this can vary from the precise monitoring and control of the enclosed system's humidity, temperature, soil and water pH, as well as many more crucially important aspects such as adaptable scheduling for lighting and water distribution.\n(See project index and breakdown for further information on the overall system design and sub-projects encompassing this entire automation task! Between CAD, PCB design, web dev, embedded RTOS, investigations into communication protocols, and MUCH more, there is a lot to check out!) Having such closely related but independently controlled sub-systems allows these components to be encapsulated within dedicated embedded systems that can then be controlled by an underlying master through a common communication protocol.\nOverview last updated - 01/10/2024 ","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/post/starting-a-project/","section":"post","tags":["LEAP","blogging","web dev","first"],"title":"LEAP - A new initiative"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"},{"body":"","link":"https://curiouscyrus.me/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
